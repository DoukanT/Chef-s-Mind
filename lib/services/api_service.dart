Beat with a whisk until the eggs and cream are incorporated. In an ovenproof saut pan over medium heat, add the butter and olive oil. When the mixture is hot, add the asparagus pieces and cook for 3-4 minutes, stirring. Add the garlic and cook for about a minute. Spread the asparagus so it is evenly distributed across the bottom of the pan. Add the egg mixture to the pan and allow the eggs to cook without mixing them. Use a rubber spatula to run around the edges of the frittata as it cooks so the edges dont stick and burn. After 1-2 minutes, add the cheese evenly to the egg mixture. When the outer edges of the frittata have set but the center is still slightly runny, arrange the cherry tomatoes and asparagus spears on the top of the frittata, sprinkle the remaining thyme over the top, then remove the pan from the heat and place it in an oven set to broil. The broiler will allow the top portion of the egg mixture to set and cook thoroughly. Keep a close watch so the frittata doesnt burn. After a few minutes, when the eggs have set completely and begin to turn golden, carefully remove the pan from the oven. Use a rubber spatula to run around the edges and underside of the frittata, and slide it onto a round serving plate. Slice and serve warm or at room temperature.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a large bowl, combine the eggs, whipping cream, salt, pepper, and half the fresh thyme.

Size of the baking dish: around 14 inch long, 10 inch wide, 3.2 inch deep Roll the pastry thin, in to the size of your baking dish. You should roll half of pastry for the bottom side of cakes and half of pastry for upper side off the cakes. The size should be just a little bigger than the size of your baking dish. Bake the pastry for about 10-15 minutes until golden brown. Cool the upper layer completely. Leave the second one (bottom layer) in the baking dish. Divide egg yolks from egg whites, putting egg whites in to the larger bowl. For the egg yolk mixture, add sugar, vanilla and rum to the egg yolks into a smaller bowl. Mix them together for a minute or two. Add flour and 1/4 off milk and mix together to get a smooth mixture. Mix egg whites in the large bowl until firm consistency. Then add sugar and mix again. The consistency after adding the sugar should be very firm. Put the rest of the milk in to a large cooking pot and bring it to boiling point. Take a whisk and slowly pour the egg yolk mixture in to boiling milk, whisking the whole time. Cook it for 5 minutes, whisking the whole time.

Shake the baking dish slightly so that every corner of pastry gets field, and leave it to cool (best is over night in the refrigerator). Mix sugar and whipping cream in a bowl.

Spread the asparagus so it is evenly distributed across the bottom of the pan. Add the egg mixture to the pan and allow the eggs to cook without mixing them. Use a rubber spatula to run around the edges of the frittata as it cooks so the edges dont stick and burn. After 1-2 minutes, add the cheese evenly to the egg mixture. When the outer edges of the frittata have set but the center is still slightly runny, arrange the cherry tomatoes and asparagus spears on the top of the frittata, sprinkle the remaining thyme over the top, then remove the pan from the heat and place it in an oven set to broil. The broiler will allow the top portion of the egg mixture to set and cook thoroughly. Keep a close watch so the frittata doesnt burn. After a few minutes, when the eggs have set completely and begin to turn golden, carefully remove the pan from the oven.

Spread the asparagus so it is evenly distributed across the bottom of the pan. Add the egg mixture to the pan and allow the eggs to cook without mixing them. Use a rubber spatula to run around the edges of the frittata as it cooks so the edges dont stick and burn. After 1-2 minutes, add the cheese evenly to the egg mixture. When the outer edges of the frittata have set but the center is still slightly runny, arrange the cherry tomatoes and asparagus spears on the top of the frittata, sprinkle the remaining thyme over the top, then remove the pan from the heat and place it in an oven set to broil. The broiler will allow the top portion of the egg mixture to set and cook thoroughly. Keep a close watch so the frittata doesnt burn.

Beat with a whisk until the eggs and cream are incorporated. In an ovenproof saut pan over medium heat, add the butter and olive oil. When the mixture is hot, add the asparagus pieces and cook for 3-4 minutes, stirring. Add the garlic and cook for about a minute. Spread the asparagus so it is evenly distributed across the bottom of the pan. Add the egg mixture to the pan and allow the eggs to cook without mixing them. Use a rubber spatula to run around the edges of the frittata as it cooks so the edges dont stick and burn. After 1-2 minutes, add the cheese evenly to the egg mixture. When the outer edges of the frittata have set but the center is still slightly runny, arrange the cherry tomatoes and asparagus spears on the top of the frittata, sprinkle the remaining thyme over the top, then remove the pan from the heat and place it in an oven set to broil. The broiler will allow the top portion of the egg mixture to set and cook thoroughly. Keep a close watch so the frittata doesnt burn. After a few minutes, when the eggs have set completely and begin to turn golden, carefully remove the pan from the oven. Use a rubber spatula to run around the edges and underside of the frittata, and slide it onto a round serving plate. Slice and serve warm or at room temperature.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"In a large bowl, combine the eggs, whipping cream, salt, pepper, and half the fresh thyme.

Even if you arent making mimosas, sparkling wine is great with eggs for two reasons. One, if youre eating eggs early in the day, sparkling wine has less alcohol. Secondly, it cleanses the palate, which is important since yolk is known to coat the palate. You could try Lanson Le Black Label Brut ( half-bottle).
